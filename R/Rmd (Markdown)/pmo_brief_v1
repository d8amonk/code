# Introduction

I have pursued two distinct - and complimentary - tasks during my first 5 months at CDOT. The first is to assist PMO in understanding the behavior of CDOT's construction contracts, with specific emphasis on predicting expenditures in the "upcoming" 24 months. The second task is to survey CDOT's ability to inform statistical (forecasting) models with up-to-date data and their resulting insights.
